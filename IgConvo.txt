Vijay
Thanks for the details

Vijay
I see that funds has been posted to your CFD account

Elvis Hlongwane
I want it to be posted to MT4 Account

Vijay
OK. As I see your MT4 is in $ so it will be converted at spot rate plus 0.3% IG conversion charges

Vijay
Please confirm if you wish to proceed so that I will instruct our client money team to process it

Elvis Hlongwane
How much will that rate work out to?

Elvis Hlongwane
USD/ZAR is currently sitting at 15.1204

Vijay
At the moment the conversion rate is at 15.12 ZAR so including IG charge it will be 15.42 ZAR

Elvis Hlongwane
Ok. What is the formular for my future considerations?

Vijay
IG conversion charge would be 0.3% so it would be 15.16 ZAR

Vijay
Sorry for the wrong figure earlier

Elvis Hlongwane
15.12 + (15.12*0.3)?

Vijay
Exactly you are right

Vijay
It would be around 15.16

Elvis Hlongwane
Cool. Please go ahead.

Vijay
Thanks for the confirmation
